## Key Components

### Game Logic (`src/app/page.tsx`)

- **State Management**: Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef) for game state
- **Guess Validation**: Checks if guessed word exists in valid word list
- **Color Logic**: Implements Wordle's exact color-matching algorithm
  - Prioritizes exact matches (green) first
  - Then marks remaining correct letters as yellow
  - Handles duplicate letters correctly
- **Keyboard Input**: Supports both physical and on-screen keyboards

### API Routes

- **`/api`**: Returns a random word from the dictionary
- **`/api/words`**: Returns the complete list of valid words for validation

### Custom Animations

Defined in `globals.css`:
- **flip**: Tile reveal animation (0.5s)
- **shake**: Invalid word feedback (0.5s)
- **toast**: Notification slide-in/out (2s)
